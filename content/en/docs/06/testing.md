In this lab we will edit our pipeline so that the Java application will be tested automatically every time the pipeline runs. Our Java example application contains a set of JUnit tests, which will be executed during a run. You can think as it of a quality-gate that the pipeline must go through, to pass successfully. When tests fail, due to a change, the pipeline also fails.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Create test stage

Basic application tests (unit tests) are executed inside a test stage.

Create a new job inside `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following configuration:

* job name: `test_application`
* stage: `test`
* image: `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11:latest`
* script:`./gradlew check`

{{% details title="test job solution" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

This is how the new job `test_application` is defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="manifests/06.0/test-job-base.yml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

{{% /details %}}

Don't forget to add the `test` stage to the stages list to make sure the job will be executed.

```yaml
stages:
  - info
  - build
  - test
```

<!-- TODO

* [ ] mobi specific tags!!

  tags:
    - mobiliar
    - build

-->


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Check the pipeline

Go to your GitLab project and check the pipelines under `CI/CD` --> `Pipelines`.

Check that the test job was successful.

Do you see the executed tests and the results?

When you see them, tell us please. We only have the return value of the test script to decide if all tests run through or one or more failed. Check the next task to see how we capture the test reports.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Show test reports

The job can be extended with an `artifacts` configuration. Dev's know that the unit test reports are stored inside the `build/test-results/` folder.

This is the configuration that makes GitLab CI/CD store the test results.

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="manifests/06.0/test-job-reports.yml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

See also the official documentation: [Unit test reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html#unit-test-reports)


This is the final pipeline that includes unit testing and recording of test results.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=4 25-33" >}}{{< readfile file="manifests/06.0/.gitlab-ci.yml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Navigate to the newest Pipeline inside GitLab. The Tests tab should now show the executed tests.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Break a test (Optional)

To show how the pipeline reacts on test failures we change a test to fail.

Open the test class `src/test/java/ch/appuio/techlab/controller/PodRestControllerTest.java`. Change the assertion from **Pod** to **Hoppla**.

{{< highlight yaml >}}
        // then
        assertThat(podDescription, startsWith("Hoppla: "));
{{< /highlight >}}

Commit and push those changes and then check that the pipeline failed and the test results inside the Tests tab have one failure.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=2-3" >}}
java.lang.AssertionError:
Expected: a string starting with "Hoppla: "
     but: was "Pod: 42"
{{< /highlight >}}

Revert the latest commit to fix the test again.
